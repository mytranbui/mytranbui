## About

I just graduated from a 9-week full-time intensive coding bootcamp at LeWagon Berlin on Web Development and also learnt mainly C programming language at 19CodingSchool, affiliated with School42. Iâ€™m now looking for a Back-End Developer job where I can apply those newly learned skills and broaden my skill set starting this year !
